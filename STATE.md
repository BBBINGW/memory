# Global FHE Research State — Independent vFHE Track

**Checkpoint:** 2026-10-14 (Asia/Tokyo)
**GLOBAL GENERAL FHE ITERATION COUNTER:** **I192 is the last completed global round. This counter is FROZEN** while the human PI directs independent vFHE work. Do not start I193+ as a continuation of the old general sequence merely because the vFHE project continues.

## CURRENT PI-SELECTED WORKSTREAM (SEPARATE COUNTER)

**vFHE cross-CRT scalar digit/index consistency**, independent round **V15 COMPLETED**, next **V16 NOT STARTED**.

**Authoritative separate round state:** `findings/vfhe-cross-crt-state.md`.
**Technical evidence + research story:** `findings/vfhe-cross-crt-consistency-research.md`.
**Current status:** Structural lookup/soundness question remains OPEN/HUMAN_REVIEW; integer-code bridge is a candidate, not a working PCS/SNARK repair. V15 shows that for two direct corrected link interfaces (individual homomorphic Pedersen digit commitments, or vector Pedersen plus separate standard IPA openings), O(log m) proof communication per native basis-coordinate linear form does NOT imply sublinear verifier GROUP work: direct MSM accounting remains O(Fm), where F is the number of separately linked extension-field instances. Source ring has N/d factors per CRT prime, so assuming F equals just the number of primes needs justification. No implemented cryptographic speedup/PCS soundness established; vFHE remains OPEN.

### Legacy numbering mapping — provenance only

An earlier short run of vFHE exploration was inadvertently recorded as global I193–I196. Reinterpret only those *vFHE-specific* records as independent **V1, V2, V3, V4** in that order. This is a bookkeeping correction, not an erasure, renumbering of file paths, or change to the earlier *general* FHE I1–I192 history. Subsequent vFHE research begins at **V5**, and increments V6, V7, ... only. Existing vFHE theory/audit files from much older global iterations (e.g. I59–I151) remain historical evidence under their original filenames.

## GLOBAL GENERAL FHE WORKSTREAM — PARKED AT I192

**Last global audited topic (I190–I192):** Qi Zhang, Mingqiang Wang, Xiaopeng Cheng, *Faster FHEW Bootstrapping with Adaptive Key Update*, CANS 2025, ePrint 2025/381, https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/381.

**Status:** PARKED — SOURCE_VERSION_GATED / HUMAN_REVIEW. Original author-edition §5.1 equations and exact DFR estimation/experimental artifact not authenticated. Existing discrepancy is conditional model/table comparison, **NOT** established published erratum, cryptographic exploit, or true DFR. For a future *PI-authorized* resumption, see archived I190–I192 evidence and `MISSING_SOURCES.md`. Do not conflate this with the currently active vFHE V-series.

Other branches including LFBS PRCA, threshold FHE PRSS, GBFV, dBFV→BGV and GL generic BigSwitch retain their prior parked/archived status in `findings/OPEN_RESEARCH_BRANCHES.md`.

## RESEARCH PROCESS

- Human PI chooses targets, major pivots, claims of contribution, and any disclosure.
- Agent follows `AGENT.md` and `RESEARCH_PHILOSOPHY.md`: read before write, one smallest falsifiable claim + one decisive test, rigorously distinguish FACT / DERIVATION / SPECULATION, verify every GitHub write by rereading.
- When working on vFHE, read its **separate state** and independent research file; do NOT use/increment the old 190+ global round sequence.
